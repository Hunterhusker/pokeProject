    I changed the starter pokemon to be the classic starters
    added a pokemon_entity constructor to make a pokemon with a given level (used a double bc bad overloading)
    Made starts be level 5, like in the real game to make the early game easier
    Added a player balance for money earned from fighting the magic rats in violation of everything PETA stands for
    Began work on a pokemart menu
        Made function to scale prices based on dist from origin bc capitalism
        Will work on more tomorrow, since I need to sleep
