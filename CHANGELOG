    creating the entity_cell class to inherit from cell to differentiate my entities from pieces of map
        The biggest difference is that they will be able to have 6 pokemon and a name
    Branched out to 1.08 and rebased since I forgot and did it in a bad order
    Converted the entity map to only be entity_cell types
        Added a destructor so that these are deleted not freed now that they arent being malloced
    Branched out again, as my inheritance is making some things weird, and I want a generic min heap
        I think I have it mostly done, but I have an exam tomorrow, and it is still buggy
        Fixed that issue cuz I am not tired yet, gonna fail this exam so hard
    This is going onto the back burner for a bit, bc I ran into some issues and I need to use comparator and such
