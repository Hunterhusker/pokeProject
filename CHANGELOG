    creating the entity_cell class to inherit from cell to differentiate my entities from pieces of map
        The biggest difference is that they will be able to have 6 pokemon and a name
    Branched out to 1.08 and rebased since I forgot and did it in a bad order
    Converted the entity map to only be entity_cell types
        Added a destructor so that these are deleted not freed now that they arent being malloced

    Paused development on the generic minheap to focus on real reqs for this assignment (those changes are in the CL in that branch)
    Added a random pokemon choosing starting screen, it randomly chooses three pokemon, and lets you choose one with space before the game starts
        All levels are 1, but they can be any pokemon, since that is the requirement, I will probably change this to be set pokemon since I'd rather that
    Added a player_cell extending entity_cell, so that the player can have all their pokemon, like an entity, but also have potions and stuff that entities don't
    Added a placePlayer function in entity.cpp so that we can place the player as a player_cell obj
    Updated existing methods to use the player as a player_cell not an entity_cell for full access to its stuff

    Made a bag menu, which is read only, since I don't know what you can do with it besides just look at it outside of battle
        Will work on more tomorrow now that I see potions should be used outside battle on pokemon, so I will try that
        Didn't do much today since it is no longer due tonight but I got the menu sorted, will polish it soon
    Fixed starter pokemon not counting towards pokemon count bug

    Started to work on the random pokemon fight menu
    Added the menu itself and got a selector working with the dpad
    Got running changes ironed out
    Got tired and went to bed

    I organized my code a bit, since main was getting a little too clogged, and I am more familiar with forward declarations
        I added a world.cpp/.h (Since I forgot to make my world into a class last time)
        I also added a new menu.cpp/.h so that all of my menus were in their own file
    I am also going to make my read in data for the file reading more global, since passing all that in is tedious
    I eliminated redundant functions
    Worked on converting char* and char[] to std::string where possible

    Fixed player spawning in exit glitch
    Continued work on the wild pokemon fight, since a lot of it's code can be used in trainer fights
        Worked on the pokemon swap menu, just needs to deal with priority, which hasn't been messed with yet
        Worked on the fight GUI itself to look more like a real battle
        Bag menu added item listing and cursor movement for selection
