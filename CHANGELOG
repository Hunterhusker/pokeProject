    Came back early to get this stuff working, so I am gonna start now
    Got curses to work with my IDE so I can use it to run and debug my code
    Reformatted the printCurr() function in main to work w/ curses instead
    tried out some basic io reading, and am going to bed so tomorrow I will work harder on IO

    Moved the entity placement to mapBuilder.c to be called upon screen generation
        Now the entities are added during screen creation, not later
    Moved the endwin() de-init to the destroy world so that it is always called before the program ends
    Added a runGame() function that moves anything in the heap and then when it sees the player, it stops and asks for input
    Got full player movement added and it cannot leave the map, interact with entities, or anything else, just move on input

    Added between screen movement for the cardinal directions
    Took a mental health day since thinking about doing the diagonals made me sad

Mar 20, 2022
    Added diagonal map movement support and a check to see if the exits are blocked
    Redid all of map movement since it was too clunky
    Redid pacers to update the buffer so we can save ourselves the trouble of redoing the screen each time
        did the same for wanderers
        did the same for random walkers, and fixed a bug w/ getting stuck in front of exits I hadn't noticed before
        did the same for hikers to finish it off
    Fixed bug where rivals and hikers don't seek you when you are in the shops/marts

    Added stationary entities back to the game clock so that they can check for players in the area to battle
    Started to work on a trainer listing function, but am stuck on reading Esc right now, did get arrow keys to work I think
