    I have done some code cleanup and removed a few methods that ended up not being used
    Added entity.h to use like an interface for the different entity types
    Using the struct from entity.h to make an entity map for the screens
    Converted the player into an entity and put it in the new entity map
        This forced me to have to move the entity struct into mapBuilder.h because of the dependencies on each other
    Added a method to handle the numtrainers switch
        made use of the atoi() method which converts char strings of numbers to ints, which is neat
        made my own method to check if the string for the trainer count has any non numeric chars, which has the most disgusting for loop I have seen

    Moved my code over to a private github repo for editing between my laptop and desktop
