    Combined all of the pokemon parts into one file, since they're really constructing one weird object
    Added a generic file opening function after I remembered how cool references are in C++
        This abstracts behavior, and makes adding new paths to check easier
    Fixed issues with the make file so that it runs again
    Added functionality to read the new stats CSVs into the game
    Stopped parsing anything in pokemon_moves that doesn't have a version_group_id of 19 to save memory
    Creating a pokemon_entity class to combine all the different pieces into one entity to fight
        Stopped bc midnight, and I think it has all the data in theory (not tested)
