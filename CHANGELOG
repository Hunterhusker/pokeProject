    Converted the entire project over to C++ and fixed the bugs so that it runs

Mar 28, 2022
    started class conversion
        Gave up for now since file reading is more important
    Tested using a priority queue as a minHeap to shorten my code and use a better heap

    Setup the pokemon class
    Got reading from the pokemon.csv working
    Population of the pokemon classes though file input works
    Added the command line flag to just do the pokemon file reading
    Added the attempts at other file reads
    Added functionality to actually run the game if the new flags arent used upon running
        Now it is past midnight so I guess I move into a new date

Mar 31, 2022 // im working until file reading is done, pray for me I have an exam tomorrow (oh yeah I make bad decisions professionally)
    ffw 2hours pokemon_species is read and implemented into the game
    Experience file parsing is now all set up
    type_names.csv parsing is all done and it is 4 am so I go to bed now
    added pokemon_moves and moves reading, which finishes file reading
    Converted the cell struct to a class (cells are map tiles and entites no inheritance yet since im running low on time, but I plan on it)
    Converted maps to a class
    Converted heatMaps to a class
