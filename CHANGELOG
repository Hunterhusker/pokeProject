    Combined all of the pokemon parts into one file, since they're really constructing one weird object
    Added a generic file opening function after I remembered how cool references are in C++
        This abstracts behavior, and makes adding new paths to check easier
    Fixed issues with the make file so that it runs again
    Added functionality to read the new stats CSVs into the game
    Stopped parsing anything in pokemon_moves that doesn't have a version_group_id of 19 to save memory
    Creating a pokemon_entity class to combine all the different pieces into one entity to fight
        Stopped bc midnight, and I think it has all the data in theory (not tested)

    Working on a constructor for the pokemon_entity so that I can encounter a random pokemon based on an id

    Got the constructor working
        Debugged issues with creation, and a weird sigsev I seemed to have fixed accidentally

    Time to scramble XD
    Set the pokemon.csv reading to ignore pokemon with ids > 898 since those are regional difference pokemon, and I don't care about them, necessary complexity
    Officially finished the pokemon since I have generated one for each possibility successfully
    Opened the file reading up to not only do version 19 moves so that more pokemon have moves
    Fixed bugs with pokemon that only have one learnable move like mf metapod, no need to have two hardens if you choose a dogshit pokemon like that
    Made a menu for the pokemon attack, no ASCII art, but I might try and add some later (MIGHT)
    Added in a chance to be attacked when walking in tall grass only
    Made it so that pokemon can only have moves that are of a lower or equal min level requirement, since it would be busted to have a level 100 move on a lvl 1
    Going to call it there since I don't have much time left, and the game is mostly functional for these requirements
