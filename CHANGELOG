    creating the entity_cell class to inherit from cell to differentiate my entities from pieces of map
        The biggest difference is that they will be able to have 6 pokemon and a name
    Branched out to 1.08 and rebased since I forgot and did it in a bad order
    Converted the entity map to only be entity_cell types
        Added a destructor so that these are deleted not freed now that they arent being malloced

    Paused development on the generic minheap to focus on real reqs for this assignement (those changes are in the CL in that branch)
    Added a random pokemon choosing starting screen, it randomly chooses three pokemon, and lets you choose one with space before the game starts
        All levels are 1, but they can be any pokemon, since that is the requirement, I will probably change this to be set pokemon since I'd rather that
    Added a player_cell extending entity_cell, so that the player can have all their pokemon, like an entity, but also have potions and stuff that entities don't
    Added a placePlayer function in entity.cpp so that we can place the player as a player_cell obj
    Updated existing methods to use the player as a player_cell not an entity_cell for full access to its stuff
