    creating the entity_cell class to inherit from cell to differentiate my entities from pieces of map
        The biggest difference is that they will be able to have 6 pokemon and a name
    Branched out to 1.08 and rebased since I forgot and did it in a bad order
    Converted the entity map to only be entity_cell types
        Added a destructor so that these are deleted not freed now that they arent being malloced

    Paused development on the generic minheap to focus on real reqs for this assignment (those changes are in the CL in that branch)
    Added a random pokemon choosing starting screen, it randomly chooses three pokemon, and lets you choose one with space before the game starts
        All levels are 1, but they can be any pokemon, since that is the requirement, I will probably change this to be set pokemon since I'd rather that
    Added a player_cell extending entity_cell, so that the player can have all their pokemon, like an entity, but also have potions and stuff that entities don't
    Added a placePlayer function in entity.cpp so that we can place the player as a player_cell obj
    Updated existing methods to use the player as a player_cell not an entity_cell for full access to its stuff

    Made a bag menu, which is read only, since I don't know what you can do with it besides just look at it outside of battle
        Will work on more tomorrow now that I see potions should be used outside battle on pokemon, so I will try that
        Didn't do much today since it is no longer due tonight but I got the menu sorted, will polish it soon
    Fixed starter pokemon not counting towards pokemon count bug

    Started to work on the random pokemon fight menu
    Added the menu itself and got a selector working with the dpad
    Got running changes ironed out
    Got tired and went to bed

    I organized my code a bit, since main was getting a little too clogged, and I am more familiar with forward declarations
        I added a world.cpp/.h (Since I forgot to make my world into a class last time)
        I also added a new menu.cpp/.h so that all of my menus were in their own file
    I am also going to make my read in data for the file reading more global, since passing all that in is tedious
    I eliminated redundant functions
    Worked on converting char* and char[] to std::string where possible

Apr 17, 2022
    Fixed player spawning in exit glitch
    Continued work on the wild pokemon fight, since a lot of it's code can be used in trainer fights
        Worked on the pokemon swap menu, just needs to deal with priority, which hasn't been messed with yet
        Worked on the fight GUI itself to look more like a real battle
        Bag menu added item listing and cursor movement for selection

Apr 19, 2022
    Worked on the bag menu, and using potions and such inside the menu
    Added a back option to not swap pokemon when choosing that in battle
    In bag menu I added potion support
        Revive support now in
    Printed the available moves and added support to select one
    Started to work on damage calculation, but it is late, and I need to read another CSV so I am going to bed
    Gave the pokemon_entity constructor access to the globals so I don't have to pass them around so much
    Got pokemon fighting working as far as I can tell
        Fixed those bugs because I apparently couldn't tell
        Basically each key stroke was considered a move so I made another loop in this mess
    Working on adding a level up check after beating a wild pokemon
    Made it so that if the default pokemon is dead, it will not start them in battle
    Fixed memory management issues
    Added a fully functional level up system, that isn't just one huge bandaid (it totally is, please don't read it for your sake)

Apr 20, 2022
    Work carried over, and tbh I don't know where one day stopped and the other began bc it is 1:40
    Did lots of debugging on wild fights, there were lots of small issues that built up to one mess
        Memory management was a disaster, leaky mf, more holes than a block of swiss cheese in that mf
        Level up system needed a bigger band-aid than was ever imaginable, I will cry myself to sleep over it in 10 minutes
    Started working on the trainer fighting mechanics by coping the entire wild fight code down to it
        Still needs more than one pokemon per trainer, the memory management to support it, and the "AI" to support it
            But I am going to bed now, I will not sleep well, this was a mistake

Apr 20, 2022 part 2:
    Worked on the trainer fight menu
        removed pokeball support
        Generated a list of pokemon for the trainer, rather than just one
        Added the 60% chance of an extra pokemon
        fixed all references to be to the trainers equipped pkmn not just the first one
        Made the trainer pick a new pokemon after it's current faints, iff there is one
    Fixed a bug with XP where upon beating something you gain no XP at all, ya know a minor issue
    Made the health stay where it is on level up
    Fixed level up so that it levels up to next experience bracket, not level, letting pokemon skip levels if they get enough XP to skip one
    Added XP share amongst all pokemon in trainer fights (Not in wild battles)
