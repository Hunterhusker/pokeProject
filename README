This is my implementation of the world, the traversal function for it, and the heatMap code to find paths to the player

    Instead of just printing all the stuff out and making a mess, I decided to have the game act as normal and add in commands
so that the TAs can move around and see everything still. Therefore you can go look at other maps and such and then decide if
you want to use the h command to see the map of the costs. I just thought it would be cleaner and let you see that I didn't
just duct tape this thing together, but it actually really works. Also I like my UI rn lol.

How to use:
n ~ go north
s ~ go south
e ~ go east
w ~ go west 
f x y ~ go to the coordinates x y
q ~ quits the game
h 'type' ~ when putting in the exact char of the enemy(without the ''), it will print the heat map above the board
     ~ valid types are R for rival and H for hiker

Any known bugs:
       Only thing I have found is when running in terminal is when I full screen it so I can see the heatmap, it may truncate the
    end of a line into the next line, I am fairly sure thats a terminal size thing, and not a real bug, since I don't see why it
    would ever do that otherwise. But I thought I would mention it.
