This is my implementation of the 1.07 pokemon interaction code.

Basically I read in the files just as before to vectors for quick access to the important data. Then I can generate a
random pokemon from the list, and have him fight us, and for now, that's all we really need.

Game Controls:

8: up
4: left
6: right
2: down

7: up left
9: up right
1: down left
3: down right

5: stay still

t: open the trainer menu
Esc: to exit trainer/fight menus
>: to enter a center or mart
<: to exit the center/mart menu

q: quit the game

How to use:
1. Make the executable w/ `make` in terminal
2. Run it w/ ./runMe
3. Optionally run it w/ `./runMe --numtrainers <int>` to have <int> number of trainers
    - or use any of the csv files names w/o ".csv" to parse them and read them ex `./runMe pokemon` to read pokemon.csv
4. Use the controls to play the game
4. Press q to quit the game
5. Success

Any known bugs:
    Have been watching for a stack smashing detected error for a while now, that hasn't popped up in a few assignments,
    but I feel like I should mention it. Other than that I have been able to successfully generate all of the pokemon
    several times, so I think we are bug free. I haven't made it out to the edges of the map, but I assume that all works,
    since I tested it artificially.
