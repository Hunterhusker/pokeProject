This is my implementation of the gameplay simulation code for 1.04

    Sadly there is no more UI for now, and since the loop is unstoppable in its current state, I added in a little
message that lets the player know it is just a sim and to use ctl + c to exit the loop.

How to use:
1. Make the executable w/ `make` in terminal
2. Run it w/ ./runMe
3. Optionally run it w/ `./runMe --numtrainers <int>` to have <int> number of trainers
4. Press ctl + c to quit the simulation, since we don't have a good way to take commands from this
5. Success

Any known bugs:
    I got it to stall once that I honestly couldn't explain or replicate. I looked at the position of every single
entity in the game, and I never found anything that I thought could be stalling it. I have also run numerous tests
and found nothing that stalls anymore. Even with over 700 entities, I do not get a stall right now. So I assume it
must either be a perfect storm situation, so I missed something and have since fixed it unknowingly. I just thought
I would mention it, just in case you guys test something and get a crazy 1 in a million thing.

    Only other "bug" is non players don't spawn on roads, but I did that on purpose to avoid wanderers being stuck
inside a road forever, so if you notice that the spawns aren't happening on the road, that is why. Not really a bug
I guess, but I thought it would be a worthwhile mention as well.
