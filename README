This is my implementation of the 1.06 file reading code.

Game Controls:

8: up
4: left
6: right
2: down

7: up left
9: up right
1: down left
3: down right

5: stay still

t: open the trainer menu
Esc: to exit trainer/fight menus
>: to enter a center or mart
<: to exit the center/mart menu

q: quit the game

How to use:
1. Make the executable w/ `make` in terminal
2. Run it w/ ./runMe
3. Optionally run it w/ `./runMe --numtrainers <int>` to have <int> number of trainers
    - or use any of the csv files names w/o ".csv" to parse them and read them ex `./runMe pokemon` to read pokemon.csv
4. Use the controls to play the game
4. Press q to quit the game
5. Success

Any known bugs:
    As of right now I haven't noticed any bugs, I think it should be fully functional
