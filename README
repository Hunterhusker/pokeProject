This is my implementation of the 1.05 curses code for the game.

To use, use the following controls

8: up
4: left
6: right
2: down

7: up left
9: up right
1: down left
3: down right

5: stay still

t: open the trainer menu
Esc: to exit trainer/fight menus
>: to enter a center or mart
<: to exit the center/mart menu

q: quit the game

How to use:
1. Make the executable w/ `make` in terminal
2. Run it w/ ./runMe
3. Optionally run it w/ `./runMe --numtrainers <int>` to have <int> number of trainers
4. Use the controls to play the game
4. Press q to quit the game
5. Success

Any known bugs:
    So like one time it said stack smashing error? I have looked into and I know it means I accessed something wrong,
but I get no warnings or errors, and I can't find it. It also happened like once or twice and I haven't got it since.
Like not in the last three days so maybe fixed???
