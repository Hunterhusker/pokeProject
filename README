This is my implementation of the 1.08 pokemon fighting code

This made me make lots of internal loops for menus inside menus, so I recommend looking at this picture while reading my code (https://imagebin.ca/v/6eSczxIzgpzq)

(Note: I made game end on black out since pokecenters aren't ready to respawn in)

Game Controls:

8: up
4: left
6: right
2: down

7: up left
9: up right
1: down left
3: down right

5: stay still

t: open the trainer menu
Esc: to exit trainer menus
>: to enter a center or mart
<: to exit the center/mart menu

Inside menus:
Arrow keys: move through menus
Spacebar: select an item in the menu
Esc: to leave bag menu ann unimplemented menus

q: quit the game

How to use:
1. Make the executable w/ `make` in terminal
2. Run it w/ ./runMe
3. Optionally run it w/ `./runMe --numtrainers <int>` to have <int> number of trainers
    - or use any of the csv files names w/o ".csv" to parse them and read them ex `./runMe pokemon` to read pokemon.csv
4. Use the controls to play the game
4. Press q to quit the game
5. Success

Any known bugs:
    I think they are ironed out now, but I have had issues with losing a fight and the game not ending, and a stack
smashing error I never "fixed" but I only saw once and could never replicate.

    I also don't consider it a bug, but for simplicity's sake I implemented XP such that the current pokemon gets it all
at the end of a fight in wild battles, and full xp share, even with fainted pokemon, in trainer battles.

    Also not a bug that you can't use potions outside of battle, I don't think that's in the game, idk I have never played it tbh
but I don't think it should be that way, and I don't see directions about it. So it's not there on purpose.
